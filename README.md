<!-- <h2>What resources and techniques do I use to learn ?</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Resources</dt>
  <dd>Udemy Courses</dd>
  <dt>As I go through the courses, I take notes along the way as well as coding along with the instructor. This helps me to retain knowledge faster and to get better muscle memory with core concepts. </dt>
  <dd>HackerRank</dd>
  <dt>I like going through HackerRanks preperation bundles because they have targeted topics like data structures. Depending on what I am learning, I like using the knowledge from the Udemy courses and then using those skills to solve problems. This cycle has helped me the most with advancing my knowledge. </dt>
